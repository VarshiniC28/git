    <p><strong>Topic:</strong> Syncing commits between old and new cloned repositories (local-to-local)</p>

    <p>
        Suppose you clone an existing remote repository (Repo A) into a new folder on your machine (creating Repo B).
        You make some changes in Repo B, commit them, and push them to the remote repository.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now, when you run <code>git log</code> in the new local repository (Repo B), you will see both the old commits
        and your new commits.
        The changes are also visible on the remote repository because you pushed them.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, if you go back to the old local repository (Repo A) and check the logs using <code>git log</code>,
        you wonâ€™t see the new commits made from Repo B immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
        To update the old local repository (Repo A) with the latest commits from the remote, run:
    </p>

    <pre><code>git fetch</code></pre>

    <p>
        After fetching, you can see the new commits using:
    </p>

    <pre><code>git log origin/main</code></pre>

    <p>
        This shows the updated commit history from the remote (which was pushed by the new repo).
    </p>

    <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Commits are stored locally unless pushed.</li>
        <li>Each cloned repo is independent but connected to the same remote.</li>
        <li>To sync another local repo, use <code>git fetch</code> to get remote changes.</li>
    </ul>
